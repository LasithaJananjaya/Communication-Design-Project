1	Readfile function -- for support general modulation
2	add GSMK modulation and demodulation

need to update:
should not processing the type conversion during socket receive, it should be done after socket recieve for improve receive speed

20070208:
1	revise the store_JPEG to store_DBPSK/DQPSK. Reason is we need other store event to deal with store_GMSK, which also store JPEG file.
